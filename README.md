Plays block game.

Powered by Baritone.

A client side bot that can accomplish any Minecraft task that is relatively simple and can be split into smaller tasks. "Relatively Simple" is a vague term, so check the list of current capabilities to see examples.

Became [the first bot to beat Minecraft fully autonomously](https://youtu.be/baAa6s8tahA) on May 24, 2021.

## How it works

Take a look at this [Guide from the wiki](https://github.com/toccatina/altoclef/wiki/1:-Documentation:-Big-Picture) or this [Video explanation](https://youtu.be/q5OmcinQ2ck?t=387)


## Current capabilities, Examples:
- Obtain 400+ Items from a fresh survival world, like diamond armor, cake, and nether brick stairs
- Dodge mob projectiles and force field mobs away while accomplishing arbitrary tasks
- Collect + smelt food from animals, hay, & crops
- Receive commands from chat whispers via /msg. Whitelist + Blacklist configurable (hereby dubbed the Butler System). Here's a [Butler system demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1axVYYMJ5VjmVHaWlCifFHTwiXlFssOUc/view?usp=sharing)
- Simple config file that can be reloaded via command (check .minecraft directory)
- Beat the entire game on its own (no user input.) This includes:
    - Building a nether portal
    - Finding a nether fortress + collecting blaze rods from a blaze
    - Trade with piglins for ender pearls, collecting + crafting gold in the nether
    - Leave nether
    - Craft + throw eyes of ender and follow direction until stronghold portal is discovered.
    - Setting spawnpoint near stronghold portal
    - Entering end portal, destroying crystals and killing the dragon as it perches.
- Print the entire bee movie script with signs in a straight line, automatically collecting signs + bridging materials along the way.
- Become the terminator: Run away from players while unarmed, gather diamond gear in secret, then return and wreak havoc.


## Download

Check [releases](https://github.com/toccatina/altoclef/releases). Note you will need to copy over both jar files for the mod to work.

This is a **fabric only** mod, currently only available for **Minecraft 1.16.5**.


## TODO's/Future Features:
- Smart tasks that are user customizable. Give resources json-assignable descriptions on how they CAN be obtained, and the system automatically tries to obtain it in the fastest way.
- Given any schematic, Collect ALL resources and BUILD the schematic, ideally from a fresh survival world if possible.
- Initialize and control multiple bots over a network. Kind of like an RTS game.
- Make this bot able to survive anarchy
- All acheivements, fully autonomous (not happening any time soon lol)

## Development

1) Clone project and import. I'd suggest using JetBrain's IntelliJ to import the project.

2) Run gradle task runClient (In IntelliJ open up the Gradle window and run altoclef/Tasks/fabric/runClient)

3) For building a jar to use as a fabric mod, run `altoclef/Tasks/build/build`. Then clone [my fork of fabritone](https://gitlab.com/adrisj7/fabritone) and perform the same build instructions/steps on that project's `fabric/1.16.3` branch.

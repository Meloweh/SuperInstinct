You'll have to clone my Fabritone-extra project and build gradle.

1) Clone git repository: https://gitlab.com/adrisj7/fabritone
(this is a fork of https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/fabritone)

2) Import Gradle Project (Preferred IDE is IntelliJ but you may try with other IDEs)

3) run gradle target: "build"

4) the following directory should now exist:
"build/libs/baritone-1.6.2-dev.jar"

5) Move "baritone-1.6.2-dev.jar" to this folder.

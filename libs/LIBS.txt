Unfortunately I didn't bother learning the specifics of gradle so I just downloaded libraries
the lazy way by finding their jars online and slapping them in here.

Until I ask somebody for help on how to get these libraries auto-configured in gradle, you'll have to
download these libraries too. Sorry!

List of Jars needed:

1) FABRITONE EXTRA:

    You'll have to clone my Fabritone-extra project and build gradle.

    1) Clone git repository: https://gitlab.com/adrisj7/fabritone
    (this is a fork of https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/fabritone)

    2) It is a Gradle Project (Preferred way is to open with an IDE like IntelliJ but you may try other ways)

    3) run gradle target: "build"

    4) the following directory should now exist:
    "build/libs/baritone-1.6.2-dev.jar"

    5) Move "baritone-1.6.2-dev.jar" to this folder.
